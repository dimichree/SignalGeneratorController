# SignalGeneratorController
Graphical user-interface for simplified control and operation of a Mini-Circuits USB Synthesized Signal Generator (SSG). Written in MATLAB, the application imports a dynamic link library (mcl_gen64m.dll), courtesy of Mini-Circuits, to implement functions that change the SSG’s transmission state, power, frequency, and dwell time while monitoring the internal temperate and connection status to the host computer in real-time.
Using visual aids, like a temperature gauge and lamp, the operator can interpret the state of the system at a glance. An activity log is located at the bottom of the figure that informs the operator of the completed action and retains previous actions from the current session. In the case of disconnection, the control components are disabled until a connection is reestablished, and a log entry is created for a connection loss.
This design had hardware constraints relating to the ‘AMPLIFIER’ component, which required a variable range for the ‘POWER’ component, dependent on the amplifier selected. As a safety precaution to prevent operators from damaging the hardware, a popup dialog box notifies the operator of the dangers for selecting the wrong amplifier after every successful connection. The ‘RF’ and ‘POWER’ components are enabled only after the operator selects an amplifier. If the operator deselects an amplifier, the ‘RF’ and ‘POWER’ components are disabled.
